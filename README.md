# Dice
This is random number generator which will generate random number from 1 to 6.
In this you can learn how to use the `while` keyword to do loops, `.lower()`, `def`and `return` functions.
For this project, I have used `random` module and `.randint()` function to get a random number.  

With this, I have attached the output of this project.
